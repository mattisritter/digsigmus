# Project Digital Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition

## Project Structure
-**[ablage](ablage)**: contains single function edits (no fft implementation at the moment --> implemented them in the project files)
-**[files](files)**: files from older branches
-**[homework_files](homework_files)**: older homework implementations by weeks
-**[ablage](ablage)**: project files containing main project as main.py with a sin and sawtooth signal. Also containg audio.py for Music Signals and hamming_audio.py with an addittional focused Hamming-Filter.
-**[results](results)**: Contains the resulting signals from the project files audio.py and hamming_audio.py
-**[soundfiles](soundfiles)**: Containg various soundfiles as examples
-**[results](results)**: Containg tesfiles (nothing implemented from me at the moment)

## TODOs:
- [ ] Writing test Functions
- [ ] Write the Documentation
- [ ] Focus on a better implementation of the project files
- [ ] Check all files and implementation listet by Prof. Stahl
- [ ] Check if the reconstructed signals can be upgraded for a better result
